I haven't had interesting topics recently at work, as we've been stuck on massive load balancing problems for over a week, as well as some redundancy experiments. So I'll talk about my computer setup.

## My setup

### The XPS

At the moment, I only use my Dell XPS 9560 (15"), which I bought in April 2017. It is equipped with:

- a non-touch matte 1920x1080 display without borders,
- 16GB of RAM (back when it was cheaper),
- a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, quad-core at 45W TDP,
- a GTX 1050 GPU that allows me to play most games at low settings, even on Linux,
- 512 GB Toshiba SSD,
- a 97Wh battery that lasts about 7 hours.

Here's my `screenfetch` output:

I imported it from France, where it cost me 1400 euros, through a relative of mine that has access to wholesale hardware rebates. It is an excellent machine, and I spend most of my time outside of work on it, especially my long 4-hours-a-day commute.

### The secondary display

To it, I attached a QNIX QX2710 27" IPS monitor which I imported from South Korea back in 2012. It only cost me $300 back then, but since then I could find cheaper and better mainstream 31.5" displays, just not where I live. It serves me very well however. In particular, I took a gamble with this [Cable Matters USB C to DVI Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012B58JRM), and it ended up working beautifully at full 2560x1440 resolution.

### The keyboard

I also use an IBM Model M keyboard from 1987, which I bought in 2011 for $40. I can't recommend those enough, though they are a dying breed.

### Others

Also pictured is the very good Dell mouse included with the laptop, as well as the very underpriced Koss KSC75 ear-clip headphones.

### Linux

After distro-hopping in the past with Antergos and Fedora, and still occasionally in the past year, trying out SolusVM and Kubuntu, I am an extremely happy Xubuntu user. Unless you are a very specific kind of user, Debian is a no-brainer for productivity these days, and Ubuntu offers some extra convenience for very minor instability. With XFCE on top, I get a very lightweight, functional and aesthetic DE. I don't have time to deal with cumbersome issues these days so it's a pleasure.

## The way forward

For the past 10 years, I've kept reading hardware news with the dream of buying tons of cool stuff. As a result, I've had a backlog of hardware to buy. Here's my dream setup:

- 3x 27" **monitors** held by a mechanical arm. I could use the screen real estate, although I'm scared I'll be spoiled forever and my commute work will be ruined even on my 15" laptop.
- A **desktop PC** with custom parts put together on [https://pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) with decent specifications, especially at least a middle-range GPU.
- A **home server** that will serve as a FreeNAS on a RAID5, as well as a NextCloud server and maybe a public server for side projects. Either a Synology device or some low-power computer like a NUC attached to a bunch of disks. I am unsure about getting a public static IPv4 address, as these cost a lot to rent from ISPs.
- A customized **router** for metrics and security. For example, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/8b0s4z/building_a_custom_router_with_arch_linux_arm_on_a/) seems like a neat little side-project, or otherwise a some Chinese box with good firmware like OpenWRT or Tomato. Coupled with a reliable Wi-Fi access point like Unifi, it would solve all my networking needs, although I might buy a small switch for some experiments.
- An **ultrabook** for my commute, for weight and battery. Probably some kind of subnotebook like a Thinkpad X1 Carbon or a Dell XPS 13.

All in all, I'll be in for $5000 at most, including good peripherals and a decent chair and table. But I'm already happy at the moment.
