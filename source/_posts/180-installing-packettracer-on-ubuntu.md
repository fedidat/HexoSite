I have just finished Cisco's CCNA course. It's quite different from my world of programming but it's always a good thing to peek at how our systems work under the hood.

Part of it required installing packettracer on my Xubuntu laptop. You can download the latest version on Cisco's networking Academy under `Resources > Download Packet Tracer`. But if you need it without passing through Netacad, you can do the following to get a barely older version:

- Head to http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~kotfid/packettracer/LinuxUbuntu/ and download the archive containing the executable.

- Unzip and execute install.

- That's it. Now just use the terminal command `packettracer` or the shortcut on your Desktop.
